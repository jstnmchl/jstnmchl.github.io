  My name is Justin Michael and I'm a medical device professional with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering.
  Since 2015, I've been involved in image guided interventions and surgical navigation, contributing to the fields of radiation oncology and orthopedics.
  I've also taken an interest in entrepreneurship and start-ups, competing in an entrepreneurship [pitch competition](https://techalliance.ca/proteus-kick-starting-road-commercialization/) in 2017 and working for a medtech scale-up in Waterloo since 2018.

   A former varsity rower, I've since taken up running, ultimate frisbee, and occassionally back-woods backpacking.  

   I'm interested in economics, psychology and Canadian politics. 
   I tend to read more non-fiction than fiction. 

   I firmly believe that a hotdog is not a sandwich.
#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
